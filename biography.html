            <h1>this is an a short autobiography about me</h1>
          
            <P class="par">My name is natnael worku. I was raised in a small town called Debre Birhan, i attedned primary at a public school named Atse Zeryakob 
                 primary school which was a rather inetresting childhood as most students in my neighborhood
                 went to private schools and my family couldnt afford to send me to a private school i used 
                 to feel so down for this reason since i couldnt make friends easily and most of my friends were 
                 going to private schools after i finished primary school i attended Debre Birhan General 
                 secondary school which was 2 of the best years of my life because i was able to take my classes
                  with my childhood friends once again then i took the national examinations to attend preparatory
                   school at Hailemariam Mamo preparatory school i was able to take part in different activites during
                    these 2 years of my life like representing our town on a regional basketball tournament that was held
                     at my home town, after i took my universtiy entrance exams we had a long summer break during which
                      i was helping my family with
                 a shop we had. when the entrance results were finally released i got the a 
                 result that could let me attend higher education, and now i am taking my classes at Addis Ababa Universtiy(eiabc)
